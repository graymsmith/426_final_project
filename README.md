# 426_final_project
Repository for files related to the final project for COMP 426 at UNC Chapel Hill (Fall 2018).



Guidelines for A- or better grade:
- Application loads as an HTML file with only one DOM load with everything else being done as a result of client-side programming.
- Retrieve and incorporate information from at least one endpoint in the API in the interface.
- At least one interactive feature in your interface that dynamically alters / updates the interface as a result of some user initiated action.
- At least use CSS (either rolled your own or from a framework), regardless of whether design is particularly good.
- ---------
- Retrieve and incorporate information from at least three endpoints in the API. (4 total?)
- Create and update information on the backend to at least one endpoint in the API.
- Use CSS effectively (i.e., application looks / feels nice to use). CSS frameworks OK.
- ---------
- Create and update information on the backend to at least three endpoints in the API. (4 total?)
- At least one live interactive feature. By this, I mean that the interface updates somehow as the user is doing something like typing, moving a slider or something like that (autocomplete, live update of list or visualization, etc.).
- Incorporating one or more third party APIs (Google Maps is an obvious one, Twitter?, Facebook?, SoundCloud?).
- Application has more than one "mode" (i.e., the interface gets torn down and rebuilt).
- Excellent design using a framework, or reasonable design rolling your own from scratch CSS.
